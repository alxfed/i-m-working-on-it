# My notebook

By sheer accident I bumped into this book here: [http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/gifi/\_book/index.html](http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/gifi/_book/index.html)  
  
I was searching for references to Yule - Pearson debacles and was lead to the page:  
[http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/gifi/\_book/introduction.html](http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/gifi/_book/introduction.html) . The page and the book itself seems to be very meaningful.

{% hint style="info" %}
I consider this to be my notebook, don't expect too much from it.
{% endhint %}

TODO:

* Finish reading Chollet
* A couple of examples in Colab...
